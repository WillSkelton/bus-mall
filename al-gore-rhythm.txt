-What do I want to make?

	=The website from Wednesday night's lecture

-How?

	= HTML:

		<body>
			<header>
				// header info (ie company name)


			<main>
				<div>
					// pic 1

				<div>
					// pic 2

				<div>
					// pic 3


	= Java-Script:

		-global array of all the pictures as objects
			= for now, call it picObjects
		-function that creates and fills an array with 3 random && unique picObjects objects
		-add those to the DOM as buttons images
